# UX

## Who is this website for?
For users who want to create and manage their recipes online.

## What it is that they want to achieve?
They need a simple way to write down new cooking recipes in an online recipe book, be able to find them, edit or delete.

## How does the project fulfil the usersâ€™ needs?
The implementation provides intuitive user interface for creation of new recipes. The website requests users to be authenticated and authorised in order to manage their own recipes. Add recipe page lists all necessary fields for writing a new recipe, e.g. recipe name, course name, ingredients, preparation steps and time. Additionally image upload option is available for users. For quick and easy search, users can use either the course cards from Home page or the search field and 'Filter by Course' dropdown located on My recipes page. Each recipe can be modified and removed. The site is functioning on desktop as well as on mobile devices.

## Wireframes
The [wireframes](https://github.com/AnaStasia1331/ms4-recipe-book/tree/master/static/img/readme/wireframes) were created using Balsamiq tool.

# Database Schema 

Heroku deployment uses the PostgreSQL relational database, whereas in the development mode the project runs on SQLite3 provided by the Django framework by default.

The database schema:
